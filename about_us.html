    <!--History-->
        <h4 class="h4">History</h4>
        <p>Lindisfarne Ballroom Dancing Club was founded in 2016 due to demand from clients. A
            couple had started a small group but this has grown significantly and lessons and dances
            are being held three times a week. The club includes ballroom dance classes for
            beginners, intermediate and advanced dancers. They also hold a weekly dance for all
            members on a Saturday night. The club is placed in the centre of Lindisfarne Island.</p>
