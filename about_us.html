        <h4 class="h4">History</h4>
        <p>Lindisfarne Ballroom Dancing Club was founded in 2016 due to demand from clients. A
            couple had started a small group but this has grown significantly and lessons and dances
            are being held three times a week. The club includes ballroom dance classes for
            beginners, intermediate and advanced dancers. They also hold a weekly dance for all
            members on a Saturday night. The club is placed in the centre of Lindisfarne Island.
            Ballroom Dance has enjoyed a revival in recent years, and is now one of the most popular
            dance styles around. With its grace, variety, and active social element, it's easy to
            understand why it continues to capture the imagination.
            So if you love the idea of twirling with confidence, learning a new life skill, and above
            all enjoying yourself, our adult Ballroom Classes are for.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ballroom Dance Community Lessons are offered as group classes.
            Classes are organized in a set of 7 classes that meet once per week called a series.
            Each series is organized to progress the students level of dance.   Once the student completes
            a series, he can then advance to the next level.  Each level builds on the previous level.
            Enrollment is for the entire series (drop-ins are not permitted).  Once a series is in progress, new
            students are no longer accepted into that series.   Students are encouraged to start at the
            beginning with Ballroom 1.
