                    Beginners group class tuition is $35 per person for an entire 5-week group class
                    series ($30 if there's only 4 weeks of class in a month), or you can drop in to
                    a single day of class for $10. Group class series tuition ONLY applies to 'that
                    month'-- You cannot pay for a $35 5-week series, then jump around from 1 group
                    class series to another, or jump around month-to-month. The classes we offer
                    change each month, and are largely based on student demand. If you wish to sample
                    many classes, we recommend trying the 1st day of each series, and paying the
                    $10 per class drop-in fee.

                    There are MANY styles of partner dance to choose from. Some dances are easier to learn than others.
                    Some dances are also more 'useful' in social dance settings such as weddings & office parties.
                    We highly recommend starting with an 'easy' dance (like nightclub two step or single time swing),
                    that you can use in social settings, like weddings and office parties.
                    We suggest learning more technically demanding dances (like international style foxtrot) after
                    you've mastered the more 'easy' dances.

                    Ballroom Dance has enjoyed a revival in recent years, and is now one of the most popular
                    dance styles around. With its grace, variety, and active social element, it's easy to
                    understand why it continues to capture the imagination.
                    So if you love the idea of twirling with confidence, learning a new life skill, and above
                    all enjoying yourself, our advanced Ballroom Classes are for you.

                    On this course, you will spend one hour on each dance.
                    The emphasis during this class will be to work on Bronze level routines,
                    including the technique needed within each dance.  The idea is that this class will
                    compliment your other training towards your Medal Tests, and give you a chance to practice
                    the steps and technique in a fun, sociable environment.  Of course, you donâ€™t have to be taking
                    Medal Tests to equally enjoy and benefit from the course.
